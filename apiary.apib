The Terminal served Houston during the years when air travelers dressed in their finest and embarked for exotic destinations aboard roaring propliners like the Douglas DC-3 and the Lockheed Constellation.\n\nDesigned by noted architect Joseph Finger (who also designed Houston's City Hall), the Terminal was built to meet Houston's growing role as a major center for air commerce in the 1930s. The Terminal was completed in 1940 and served as the primary commercial air terminal for Houston until 1954.\n\nWhile most major cities have razed the beautiful art deco airport terminals of the 1930s and 1940s to make way for modern buildings, jet traffic or the closing of airports, the Houston Municipal Airport Terminal stands on William P. Hobby Airport as a quiet monument to the rich and varied history of aviation in the region.\n\nThe Aviation Heritage Gallery features exhibits on the Douglas DC-3, including original oil paintings by Jonathan Frank.\n\nThe Airline Galleries, Hall of Flight, and Starliner Theater feature original aviation art, stunning period photographs, outstanding scale aircraft models, artifacts, uniforms, memorabilia and documents of various airlines, Howard Hughes and Houston Cessna dealer King Cruse.\n\nThe Aviation Meteorology and Air Traffic Control Galleries feature vintage weather and ATC equipment such as teletypes, radios, and light guns as well as weather charts and navigational maps. The galleries also feature Houston's aviation history and the history of learning to fly.\n\nThe Children's Dream of Flight Gallery features vintage aviation toys, games, and books as well as an aviation play table and reading library to inspire young visitors to dream of flight.",

On view at Holocaust Museum Houston’s Mincberg Gallery January 20 through May 30, 2017, “A Celebration of Survival” inspires visitors to focus on what “could be” rather than the horrors of the past.Upon entering, visitors will pass through “Veils of Remembrance,” diaphanous silk veils featuring life size portraits of children of the Holocaust, creating the effect of walking among them. “Portrait Walls” throughout will don 16 righteous non-Jews of the 26,000 “Righteous Among the Nations” who saved Jewish lives during the Holocaust, while “Quotations” will project prolific words by local survivors and other prominent Jewish thinkers. Deeper into the exhibition, an audio-visual installation featuring New Dimensions in Testimony, created by USC Shoah Foundation – The Institute for Visual History and Education, will invite students and adults to hold a “virtual conversation” by “talking” with a Holocaust survivor. This pioneering project integrates advanced filming techniques, specialized display technologies, and next-generation natural language processing to provide an intimate experience with Holocaust survivor Pinchas Gutter, an eyewitness to history who can answer direct questions while sitting in front of you in a three dimensional, face-to-face interaction. Through the artistry of Barbara Hines and “A Celebration of Survival,” Holocaust Museum Houston is one of only five locations in North America to ever host this extraordinary learning technology. Barbara Hines is an international artist based in Texas with studios in Houston and Aspen, Colorado. Holocaust Museum Houston presents her first solo multimedia exhibition. Hines is represented by the Meredith Long Gallery in Houston and Gallery 1949 in Aspen, Colorado.",

Barbara Hines is an international artist based in Texas with studios in Houston and Aspen, Colorado. Born in Germany, Hines immigrated as a young child with her family to Australia. Upon graduation from the University of Sydney, she returned to Germany as a foreign language teacher. Hines later moved to New York City where she studied design and art at The New York School of Interior Design and Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. While raising a family between Houston, Colorado and London, Hines painted and exhibited landscape, figure and still life paintings in oil on canvas. She currently is focused on her large, biblically inspired abstracts and Jerusalem landscapes in mixed media. Holocaust Museum Houston presents her first solo multimedia exhibition. Hines is represented by the Meredith Long Gallery in Houston and Gallery 1949 in Aspen, Colorado.",

            "event_description":"The new special exhibit of the San Jacinto Museum of History, \"A Destined Conflict: The U.S. - Mexican War,\" opened on July 4, 2015 with prints, political cartoons, photographs, art, artifacts and newspapers relating to that decisive war which occurred from 1846 to 1848, from the first engagement in Palo Alto, Texas to the Halls of Montezuma in Mexico City.  The first armed conflict involving the United States that was chiefly fought on foreign soil, the official cause of the war was both the American annexation of the Republic of Texas and the border dispute whether the national border was Texas' claim of the Rio Grande or Mexico's claim of Nueces River. By the war's end, Mexico lost nearly half of its territory and the United States became a continental power.   In \"A Destined Conflict: The U.S. - Mexican War,\" a wide array of contemporary artifacts-from newspapers and prints, to documents and artifacts written and owned by many key players in the conflict-grant insights into how the officers, the soldiers in the field, and the media back home viewed this conflict that saw many more soldiers dying from disease than battle.  \"This war pitted a politically divided and militarily unprepared Mexico against the expansionist-minded administration of U.S. President James K. Polk, who believed the United States had a manifest destiny to spread across the continent to the Pacific Ocean,\" says Larry Spasic, President, San Jacinto Museum of History Association. \"War costs exceeded $100 million and more than 13,000 combatants lost their lives, making it, as a percentage of those who served, second only to the Civil War as the bloodiest conflict in American history.\" When the war ended, Mexico had lost a significant portion of its territory, including nearly all of present-day California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo marked the end of that war and the beginning of a lengthy U.S. political debate over slavery in the acquired territories, as well as continued conflict with Mexico over boundaries.   Tickets: Admission to the special exhibit-scheduled to be up for at least a year-is $5 for adults and $3 for children under 11. Combo tickets for this new special exhibit, Texas Forever!! The Battle of San Jacinto multimedia presentation, and the elevator ride to the Observation Level are available. Seniors, children and groups of 10 or more enjoy a discounted rate year-round; members of the Museum Association and the Military receive free admission to all attractions within the Monument. The Museum, exhibit and battleground are open from 9AM-6PM; the observation floor is open from 9AM-5:45PM.",

            "event_description":"Anya Tish Gallery is pleased to present Glacial Parallax, an exhibition featuring new work by Romania-born, Houston-based artist Adela Andea. Internationally recognized for her mesmerizingly luminous sculptures and installations, Andea animates industrial lights, motors, and plastics into biomorphic structures that more closely resemble organic material, from nebulas to glaciers to sea anemones, and erects engulfing environments that descend from the ceiling and climb walls like ivy.  Glacial Parallax will be Andea’s fourth solo exhibition with Anya Tish Gallery.The interaction between humans and technological advancement, the issues raised through the dynamic and swift spread of industrialization, and the responsibility for research that ensures both technological progress and ecological balance are the catalysts of Andea’s work. The concept for her newest series¬–in which she hand cuts, files, and sews together colored shards of reflective Plexiglas–emerged during a trip to Alaska where she witnessed the effects of the rapid melting of glaciers.  While the exhibition’s title, Glacial Parallax, refers to the phenomenon where an object appears to change position when viewed from different angles, it also serves as a metaphor for the vastly different points of view on environmental issues.Adela Andea received her Masters of Fine Art in 2012 from the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas, becoming the inaugural graduate of the school’s New Media program.  Since then, her sculptures and installations have been widely exhibited in such museums and institutions as The Museum of Arts and Design, New York City, NY; Blue Star Contemporary Art Museum, San Antonio, TX; Crystal Palace, Bordeaux, France; The Museum of Geometric and MADI Art, Dallas, TX; Galveston Arts Center, Galveston, TX; and The Grace Museum, Abilene, TX. Her visionary installations have awarded her invitations to many art fairs, as well as to the Zebra3 Artist Residency in Bordeaux, France, the 2013 Texas Biennial, the 2015 International Kinetic Exhibition and Symposium in Boynton Beach, Florida, and the 18th Annual Texas Sculpture Symposium, held at Texas Tech University in 2015.  Her work has been featured on PBS, MoMA Talks, in the Houston Chronicle, art ltd. magazine, and ModernDallas, and can be found in several national and international private and corporate collections. Most recently, Primordial Garden, her monumental 15,5003-feet installation, was acquired by Texas Tech University for their permanent collection.",
